export const TEXT = 'I hate the color of this phone. It\'s so ugly!\nI bought this phone a week ago, and I\'m already frustrated with the battery life. It barely lasts half a day with normal usage. I expected more from a supposedly high-end device\nThis phone heats up way too quickly, especially when using demanding apps. It\'s uncomfortable to hold, and I\'m concerned it might damage the internal components over time. Not what I expected\nDisappointed with the battery life! The phone barely lasts half a day with regular use. Considering how much I paid for it, I expected better performance in this department.\nThis phone sucks! I\'m returning it.\nEvery time I open Instagram, my phone freezes and crashes. It\'s so frustrating!\nSo, my phone\'s been in my pocket with just keys â€“ no ninja moves or anything. Still, it managed to get some scratches. Disappointed with the build quality.\nConstant crashes and freezes make me want to throw it into a black hole.\nThe software updates are a nightmare. Each update seems to introduce new bugs, and it takes forever for them to be fixed.\nTook a slight bump in my bag, and the frame got dinged. Are we back in the flip phone era?\nI dropped the phone from a short distance, and the screen cracked easily. Not as durable as I expected from a flagship device.\nI\'m not sure what to make of this phone. It\'s not bad, but it\'s not great either. I\'m on the fence about it.\nForget about a heatwave outside; my phone\'s got its own. It\'s like a little portable heater. Not what I signed up for.\nThe charging port is so finicky. Sometimes it takes forever to charge, and other times it doesn\'t even recognize the charger. Frustrating experience!\nThis phone is like holding a hot potato. Video calls turn it into a scalding nightmare. Seriously, can\'t it keep its cool?';
